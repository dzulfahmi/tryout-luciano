JavaScript was first conceived in 1993 in the heady days of Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. The then king of browsers, Netscape Navigator founder Marc Andreessen believed that Netscape needed a “glue language” to support HTML that would be easy use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the Web page markup. Also Bill Gates’ Microsoft Internet Explorer was eating into market share of Netscape Navigator forcing Andreessen to recruit Brendan Eich with the goal of embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator.
